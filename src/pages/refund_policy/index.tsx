        Refunds (if applicable)
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Our policy lasts for 7 days. If 7 days have gone by since your purchase,
        unfortunately we can’t offer you a refund or exchange.
        <br />
        <br />
        To be eligible for a refund, you must claim a refund with a legit reason
        within 7 days of the purchase. The item should be unused and in the same
        condition that you received it (in case of live courses the refund must
        be claimed within 7 days since the course has started while in case of
        video courses, one can claim a refund only if the service is unused)
        <br />
        <br />
        To complete your refund, we may require a receipt or proof of purchase.
        <br />
        <br />
        There are certain situations where only partial refunds are granted: (if
        applicable)
        <br />
        <br />
        Services with obvious signs of use.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once we make sure that the refund request is genuine, we will send you
        an email to notify you that we have approved your request. We will also
        notify you of the rejection of your refund if not approved. If you are
        approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will
        automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of
        payment, within a certain amount of days.
        <br />
        <br />
        Late or missing refunds (if applicable) If you haven’t received a refund
        yet, first check your bank account again. Then contact your credit card
        company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.
        Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a
        refund is posted. If you’ve done all of this and you still have not
        received your refund yet, please contact us at support@gmail.com.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sale items (if applicable) Only regular priced items may be refunded,
        unfortunately sale items cannot be refunded.
        <br />
        <br />
        Exchanges (if applicable) We don&apos;t replace items as these are not
        physical products and the service could be easily exploited.
